"""
A tree (or more accurately, graph) based representation of combinations of elements.

Combinations are represented as tuples. For example, if the possible elements are {A,B,C,D}, the combination A+C is represented as (1,0,1,0).

Nodes will be assigned under the following principle : each node X that contains all flags of a node Y.
For example, (1,0,0) is a parent of (1,0,1) but not the other way around.

A Library is a set set of nodes starting with a root of (0,0,0,...)
