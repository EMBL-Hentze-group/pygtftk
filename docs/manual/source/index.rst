Gtftk documentation page
========================

The gtftk program is intended to **ease handling of gtf files**. One of our objective is to propose a set of tools that **performs common  tasks** to limit the use of obfuscating code that limits readability of bioinformatics workflows. Gtftk implements several tools than can be piped to filter, extract or convert data from gtf files. 
Gtftk comes with an **API** that may be helpful to deal with genomic annotation in Python and to **develop your own scripts**. These scripts can easily become **plugins of gtftk** by simply copying them into the appropriate directory.
